# Description

ReadingList explores custom directive communication inside of an AngularJS v1.6 application.

The purpose is to demonstrate complex data flow capabilities outside of more traditional approaches.

Other concepts include:

* transclusion
* fake api injection
* flexbox
* sass mixins
* ui-router
* link functions
* unit and e2e testing
* separation of concerns

# Instructions

The main application begins with a series of post snippets. Each snippet displays its post title and part of its body.

Clicking on 'Read More' changes the state of the application, scrolling up to view the full post body.

Clicking on 'Add to reading list' in the same blurb will add the post's title to the 'Reading List' box in the lower right corner of the application.
